# FISH SCALE COUNTER AND PAST-LIFE ANALYZER üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: FISH LOVERS


### Team Members
- Team Lead: HADIYA ANIL - ILAHIA COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY
- Member 2: NABEESA FARSANA - ILAHIA COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY
  

### Project Description
"An utterly pointless web app that counts the ‚Äòscales‚Äô on your uploaded fish photo (completely randomly), marks them on the image, and then reveals the fish‚Äôs ridiculous past life ‚Äî including its date of birth, tragic cause of death, past relationships, and bizarre family history. A scientific breakthrough nobody asked for." üêü‚ú®

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
"Solving the global crisis of not knowing how many scales your fish had and uncovering the scandalous secrets of its past life ‚Äî because the world truly needed this."

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
"Upload a fish photo, get random scale count, and receive a totally fake, overly dramatic fish biography."
